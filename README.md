Hello,
I'm building a chatbot with tensorflow if you would like to try it.

1. Set your virtual environment
2. Install requirements
3. Run brain, if it works the word done will appear on your terminal.
4. Run chat to star talking with the bot.

Note: If you would to add more words to train him, please edit intents.json or use your own json file.


***I'll be glad to read your comments, observations, corrections or contributions please write me back to work together.
